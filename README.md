Sure, here's an example README.md file that provides instructions for installing dependencies and running the application using `yarn`:

# My Awesome Tic Tac Toe

This is my awesome application that does amazing things.

## Installation

To install the dependencies for this application, you'll need to have Node.js and Yarn installed on your system. If you don't have them already, you can download and install them from the official websites:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

Once you have Node.js and Yarn installed, you can run the following command in the root directory of your project to install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

This will download and install all the necessary dependencies specified in the `package.json` file.

## Running the Application

To start the application, run the following command in the root directory of your project:

```bash
yarn start
```

This will start the application and open it in your default web browser. If the application doesn't open automatically, you can open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to view the application.

That's it! You're now ready to start using the application.
